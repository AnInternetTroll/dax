# Dax

A task given by my teacher to make a website which

- [x] Saves the names of who goes to the site and shows it to future visitors
- [x] Generate lucky number every minute.

# Running the server

Install deno and run

```console
$ ./app.ts
$ # Or 
$ deno run --allow-net --allow-read=. app.ts
```

# Developing

All server code goes in `app.ts` and `static/` holds all static content.
